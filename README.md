# To-Do-List
A simple web application to store all of your To Do's!

This is a small project I made using javascript, css, html and webpack. This web app helps you keep notes on what steps you need to take
to complete a project and you can tick to dos' from the list once you have completed them. This is a basic project and I will keep on updating it until there is nothing to add to the project. It also stores data on the local storage so once you change something it will remain like that unless you switch browsers or delete your local storage items. I didn't use any frameworks and made everything using simple javascirpt and vanilla css.

# How to
First you need to create a project to store all of your to dos'. To do that click on the big yellow button that says 'New Project'. It will pop up a form for you to fill to create the project. 

After that you will need to create as many todos you need. To do that you will need to click the big plus button on the screen and fill the form to create the to do. Once you have completed the task you can tick on the big checkbox to mark it as completed.

# Lew skills learned
I learned about how to create modules, import and export them through the help of webpack.
I also learned about storing complex data in local storage and accessing them and changing them again.
I think I also improved my problem solving skills because I had encountered some bugs which were really hard to fix.

# Update
Added the feature to be able to add names of people when you create a project and then assign them some to-dos to your liking.
